{"name":"www.citoengine.org","tagline":"Alert Management and Automation","body":"### What is CitoEngine?\r\nConfiguring monitoring systems to alert properly is an art.  It's a fine art of configuring thresholds when your monitoring parameters vary widely or when the monitoring tools lack capability to monitor dynamic workloads. It also takes discipline in working with monitoring systems during release process or outages. Not all monitoring systems are configured or maintained properly. In the ned you have alerts and lots and lots of it. CitoEngine allows you to manage large volume of alerts and trigger action to notify or act on the alert by executing a script (a plugin).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://citoengine.readthedocs.org. Pull requests to improve the documentation is welcome!\r\n\r\n### Reporting Bugs and Support\r\nCitoEngine is open source. If you find bugs, please open an issue on CitoEngine GitHub repository. If you have a patch, we will be thrilled to review and accept pull requests! We are working on a form or a mailinglist for discussions -- we will keep you posted when ready.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
