{"name":"www.citoengine.org","tagline":"Alert Management and Automation","body":"### What is CitoEngine?\r\nConfiguring monitoring systems to alert properly is an art.  It's a fine art of configuring thresholds when your monitoring parameters vary widely or when the monitoring tools lack capability to monitor dynamic workloads. It also takes discipline in working with monitoring systems during release process or outages. Not all monitoring systems are configured or maintained properly. In the ned you have alerts and lots and lots of it. CitoEngine allows you to manage large volume of alerts and trigger action to notify or act on the alert by executing a script (a plugin).\r\n\r\nCitoEngine is ideal for use where many teams manage production systems or have a central team monitoring large systems with multiple monitoring systems.\r\n\r\n### What can it do?\r\n* Accept alerts from monitoring systems such as Nagios, Sensu etc and aggregate alerts to one or many. \r\n* Lookup such alerts to Event ID's (manually created) and enable any action based on rules that meet certain criteria\r\n* Plugins enable action on Incidents. Plugins can be any script that run commands or make API calls.\r\n* Dashboards to given you an overview of incoming alerts or alerts by Teams\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nThe current code is beta quality. We need more testing to make it production ready. We will be adding minor features as well. As more reports of testing is available, we will tag the release production ready. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCitoEngine is created and maintained by Cyrus Dasadia (@ExtremeUnix).
